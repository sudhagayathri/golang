sudo apt install protobuf-compiler

Protobuf is the most commonly used IDL (Interface Definition Language) for gRPC.
 It's where you basically store your data and function contracts in the form of a proto file.

 ---------------
 JSON vs Binary Encodings:
 -----
 json:
 ----
 it s text based encoding, hence size s large
 doesnt impose any validation on schema level
pros:
 json - will be readable
 widely supported by JS
 simplicity in storing

 Cons:
 each data is defined by type, hence it defautly allots lot of memory and json can keep growing
 takes lot of space,and lags in processing speed incase of lot of data,1 tb

 Binary Encodings:
 -------------
 better compression
 faster processing - When using Protocol Buffers for sending messages over the network,
  the payloads are serialized in binary. So they are much smaller when compared to XML or JSON
  hence much used in microservices a lot
  
  Schema and Validation
  
  Backward Compatability: By using the unique field number, 
  Protocol Buffer offers excellent backward compatibility. 
  Users can easily add or delete a field on the sender/recipient side without worrying about compatibility issues.

 when new fields are added, there shud be
 a.forward compatibility - old code can handle new data
 b. backward compatibility - new code shud handle old data
