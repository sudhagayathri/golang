A local procedure call is fn call within a process to execute code

A Remote procedure call is enbles one machine to invoke code on other machine

it does streaming-continuous flow of data, not single request, single response

Adv of grpc:
----------
1. protocol buffers - RPC methods and procedures are generated in proto file, these generated fns are used to make rpc calls
2. use of http/2 - It allows mutiple streams of msgs over single long-lived Tcp connection, this allows
    grpc to handle concurrent calls 


How grpc works?
---------
if there are two services which are in different process, 

Order service, payment service
the order service(grpc client service) wants to send req and get res frm payment service

grpc client(order service)->invokes client code generated by grpc->encodes data passed to client stub by protocol buffers->
sends to transport layer->sends data over n/w as stream of http/2 dataframse-> GRPC SERVER(payment service)->
decodes->gets res->encodes->sends data over n/w->decodes and given to client

why is it not commonly used btn web clients and web servers:
-------------------
grpc relies on lower level access to http/2
no browsers currently provide that level of control requireed to support grpc client
it is possible from browsers to make grpc calls through proxy, this is called GRPC-WEB

It is majorly used for microservice comm

what is http/2:
------------
http/2 uses http streams
unlike http/1, it can send multiple streams over single tcp connection
and there is no order requireed for this multiple streams while sending and receiving

4 ways of services:
-------
1. unary - notmally what rest does
2. server streaming - the client sends one single request, the server sends stream of data in responnse
3. client streaming - the client instead of single request, sends stream of request
4. Bidirectional streaming - client sends stream of msgs, server processes and
 server also sends stream of data back to client
